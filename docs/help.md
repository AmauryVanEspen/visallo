# Getting Help

Having trouble? We'd like to help!

* Read the [developer guide](developer.md). We're continually working to make this a valuable resource for people
looking to develop on the Visallo platform.
* Look for a README file in the root directory of a component. We often document component-specific information in a
README file in the root directory of a component. Keeping the documentation close to the code it describes makes it
more likely to stay up to date.
* Search for information in the archives of the [visallo mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/visallo). If you
don't find what you're looking for, post a new message.
* Visit the [Visallo blog](http://visallo.org/blog). We regularly post examples of using Visallo and announcing new features.
* Search for a bug on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/v5analytics/visallo/issues). Create a new one if you don't
find an existing report of your problem.
* Read the [source code](source-code.md). Yes it's tedious, but it's also undeniably authoritative.
