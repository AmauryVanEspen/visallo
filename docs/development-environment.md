# Development Environment

The Visallo development environment is very similar across Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux platforms and requires only a few dependencies to get started. In general, the only required dependencies are a Java SDK and Docker. An installation of VirtualBox is also required on Mac OSX and Windows but will be installed by Docker Tools if it's not already present on your system. Please see the section below for platform-specific instructions on installing the required dependencies.

## Mac OSX

The `bin/setup-osx-env.sh` script automates much of the development environment installation and setup. The script will prompt you with instructions for the manual steps you'll need to perform.

## Windows

## Linux
